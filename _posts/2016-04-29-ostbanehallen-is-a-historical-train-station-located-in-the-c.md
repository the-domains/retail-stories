## Østbanehallen - travel comforts

Østbanehallen is a historical train station located in the center of Oslo. Today it contains store and restaurants, but it used to be a connecting point for the capital to rest of Norway. The building was build purposely at the end of Karl Johan street in a straight line from the kings castle. This was a very modern idea to city planing in the 19th century when it was constructed. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0dc50319-6220-4390-bf65-551aede96c2f.jpg)

The central position ment that transportation of people and gods into the city was a lot faster and easier. Naturally this was a very important building.

"Yo! Sushi takes you to Japan" is the message on Østbanehallens site. This is the core of the idea. We know that when you enter østbanehallen you want to experience authentic japanese food. This is of course not authentic or at best fake authentic japanese food, but you want this to be real. It probably helps of the chef i japanese.
